In this directory we collect some scripts (in bash) to talk to the NPO API. They serve as example, but also can be used to quickly explore content.

Credentials must be stored in a file 'creds.sh', which can be in ../../../creds.sh. See [../creds-example.sh]

The scripts can be called without arguments to get a concise explanation about how to use them. 

See [../api-functions.sh]
